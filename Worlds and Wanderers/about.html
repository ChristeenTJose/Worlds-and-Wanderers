			<p>"An online database management system for book traders‚Äù</p>
			<p>Worlds and Wanderers is an online database management project aimed at providing an interactive interface between those who love reading books and those who need to sell books. Online bookstores can bring a variety of never before heard books to the attention of the book reader/customer that he/she may find interesting. Moreover, online bookstores provide people with not only the facility to order books from any location they prefer but also to choose from a wide range of collections. For the bookseller, the database project helps to expand his/her reach of customers.
